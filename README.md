All future updates will be published on my blog https://0x00rick.github.io/ !
Feel to visit and check out if there is any new content.


# README
In here you can find a random collection of binaries from challenges, forums, ctfs meant to be reverse engineered.  

The write ups were originally meant to be a personal learning experience only and include a .bndb file for BinaryNinja. 

I will try to keep this updated with new material and hopefully I can take a look at IDA along the way too!  

Feel free to reach out if you catch any errors, or in the rare case when having questions :).
